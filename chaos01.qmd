## 0-1 Test for Chaos

The 0-1 Test is a binary diagnostic for determinism and chaos. While the Lyapunov Exponent asks, "How fast do nearby points diverge?", the 0-1 Test asks, "Does the data behave like a predictable machine or like a random walk?"

## The Core Intuition

Imagine taking your time series and using its values to "drive" a point on a 2D plane.

1. If the system is Regular (periodic), the point will move in circles or stay in a tight, bounded area.

2. If the system is Chaotic, the point will wander away from its starting position, mimicking a Brownian Motion (random walk).

## 2. How the Algorithm Works

The 0-1 Test avoids the complexities of phase space reconstruction by mapping the 1D time series into a 2-dimensional plane. Think of it as a "driven" system where your data acts as the steering input for a particle.

### Step 1: Coordinate Transformation
Given a time series $x_n$ for $n = 1, 2, \dots, N$, we choose a constant $c \in (0, \pi)$ and define two new coordinates, $p_n$ and $q_n$:

$$p_n = \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j \cos(jc), \quad q_n = \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j \sin(jc)$$

These coordinates represent a trajectory in a 2D plane (the $(p,q)$-plane).



### Step 2: Mean Square Displacement (MSD)
We analyze how the distance from the origin grows over time. We calculate the Mean Square Displacement, denoted as $M_n$:

$$M_n = \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} [ (p_{j+n} - p_j)^2 + (q_{j+n} - q_j)^2 ]$$

* **If the system is Regular:** the $(p,q)$ trajectory stays in a bounded area (like a circle or a torus), and the $M_n$ remains small and bounded.
* **If the system is Chaotic:** the $(p,q)$ trajectory behaves like a **Brownian Motion**, and $M_n$ grows linearly with time $n$.

### Step 3: The Chaos Parameter ($K$)
The final step is to determine the growth rate of $M_n$. This is typically done by calculating the correlation between $M_n$ and the time $n$.

The result is the **$K$-value**:
* **$K \approx 0$**: Indicates a non-chaotic (periodic or quasi-periodic) system.
* **$K \approx 1$**: Indicates a chaotic system.

## Why it works 
The 0-1 test is essentially a test for the **Statistical Limit Theorem**. In the periodic case, the coordinates $p$ and $q$ satisfy a central limit theorem type of behavior only if the system is chaotic, causing the diffusive (random walk) behavior in the $(p,q)$-plane.
