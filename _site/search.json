It ensures our coordinates are mathematically independent.\nEmbedding Dimension (\\(m\\)): The total number of dimensions needed to ensure the system’s trajectory doesn’t intersect itself.\n\nThe netfit function fits a neural network to this unfolded data. This isn’t for “prediction” in the traditional sense; rather, the network serves as a differentiable surrogate for the unknown physical laws governing the system. By calculating the Jacobian of this network, we can rigorously quantify chaos.\n\nmodel = netfit(btc_1d$High, m = 1:6,lag = 1:6,timelapse = \"FIXED\",h = 2:10)\njacobian = jacobian.net(model = model)\nsummary(model)"

However, in Dynamical Systems theory, we assume there is an underlying state \\(x_t\\) that evolves according to a rule, and our data \\(y_t\\) is what we managed to measure.\n\nThe Observation Projection\n\\[y_t = h(x_t) + \\epsilon_t\\]\nWhere: * \\(x_t\\) is the true state (often hidden/latent). * \\(h\\) is the measurement function (mapping the complex system to a single number). * \\(\\epsilon_t\\) is the noise (uncertainty or measurement error).\nThe key insight: If the underlying system is deterministic, we can often “reconstruct” the dynamics of the whole system just by looking at a single time series using techniques like Delay Embedding."
