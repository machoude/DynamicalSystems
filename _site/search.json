The Bridge: How a Time Series is a Dynamical System\nA Time Series is often just a “shadow” or a partial observation of a higher-dimensional dynamical system.\nIn classical statistics, we often view a series \\(Y = \\{y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n\\}\\) as a sequence of random variables. However, in Dynamical Systems theory, we assume there is an underlying state \\(x_t\\) that evolves according to a rule, and our data \\(y_t\\) is what we managed to measure.\n\nThe Observation Projection\n\\[y_t = h(x_t) + \\epsilon_t\\]\nWhere: * \\(x_t\\) is the true state (often hidden/latent). * \\(h\\) is the measurement function (mapping the complex system to a single number). * \\(\\epsilon_t\\) is the noise (uncertainty or measurement error).\nThe key insight: If the underlying system is deterministic, we can often “reconstruct” the dynamics of the whole system just by looking at a single time series using techniques like Delay Embedding."
