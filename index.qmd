# ![]()Overview

This website collects **theory-driven examples** of dynamical systems implemented in **R**, with an emphasis on nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and predictability from time series.

The goal is not speed. The goal is understanding.

Start with nonlinear dynamical systems, then move to practical tools like the `DChaos` library.
